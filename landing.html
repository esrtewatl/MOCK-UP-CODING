              "I was thinking about this last week and realised it's because so
              much about space makes me feel like a kid again. It brings me back
              to the first time I was told about wormholes and how vast the
              universe is (or, rather, how vast we think it is based on what
              we've seen thus far."

              "Space is the land of great new adventure and full of mysteries.
              We never knew until a few hundred years ago that we could know
              something about it. It's stunning to me that we now have a clear
              idea of our age, size, motions and general composition of the
              early period all from one theory.

              "I think our curiosity and imagination will continually push us
              forward, even if the end result is a brick wall and we never
              escape our solar system. I think humanity's greatest achievement
              will be to strive for greatness, even if we ultimately fail. It's
              Space that provides us with that drive, will, determination and
              imagination."
